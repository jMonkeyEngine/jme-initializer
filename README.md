### What is this repository for? ###

This is a server side application to support rest calls (probably from a web UI "somewhere") that will produce a starter
gradle JMonkey project as a zip based on user choices. 

It also contains a basic HTML page for accessing that rest API, however that is for local testing only and isn't 
"real"

### How do I get set up? ###

* You will need a java 17 JDK & IDE of your choice that supports gradle
* Start the application by running JmeInitializerApplication
